Project proposal  
  
## Project: Convex Hull  
  
### Project Topic  
  
For my project I will compare the two algorithms we learned in class for finding the convex hull of a given set of points, the Quick-Hull and the brute force algorithm. Also, time permitting I would also like to implement the Graham-Scan algorithm, and compare it to the previous two.

### Implementation Language

For this project I plan to use the Ruby programming language. I chose this language for several reasons. First, I am experience with Ruby. Second, Ruby is easy to read, which will allow me to analyse the efficiency of the algorithm without getting caught up in complicated syntax.

Also, Ruby has a simple and easy to use testing module, [Benchmark][1], which will allow me to write extensive test. And a nice graphing library, [RubyVis][2], which will allow me to make graphical representation of my test output.


### Features in Final Report
        - A mathematical analysis of time efficiency.
                - Quick-Hull  
                - Brute Force Hull
        - An Empirical analysis of time efficiency.
                - Quick-Hull
                - Brute Force Hull
        - A graphical representation of test.
        - A comparison between the Quick-Hull and Brute force algorithms.
        - Optional
                - Implementation and analysis of the [Graham Scan][3] algorithm.

This is my tentative time plan for the project.
