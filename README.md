## Project: Convex Hull

### Project Topic

For my project I will compare the two algorithms we learned in class for finding the convex hull of a given set of points, the Quick-Hull and the brute force algorithm. I will compare the time efficiency both mathematically and empirically for random sets of points. I will also compare them on some special cases, such as a set of points in a circle, and points on a line. 

I think it will be interesting to see if the brute force algorithm ever out performs the Quick-Hull algorithm on any sets. And if so, by how much.

### Implementation Language

For this project I plan to use the Ruby programming language. I chose this language for several reasons. First, I am experienced with Ruby. Second, Ruby is easy to read, which will allow me to analyse the efficiency of the algorithm without getting caught up in complicated syntax. 

Also, Ruby has a simple and easy to use testing module, Benchmark, which will allow me to write extensive test. And a nice graphing library, RubyVis, which will allow me to make graphical representation of my test output.
